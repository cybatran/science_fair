              <p> We started of with a simple question, <strong>Which animal’s 
              design can be replicated in order to create the most energy-efficient 
              underwater robot?</strong>It was observed that many aquatic animals
              possessed traits and
              movements that allowed them to travel effectively in water. 
              However, it was unknown which animal’s design could be replicated 
              in order to create the most effective underwater robot. Creating 
              an energy-efficient underwater robot is important because the 
              technology can be used for a variety of purposes, including 
              researching marine wildlife, harnessing ocean currents for energy,
              and exploring underwater areas. Many research companies have 
              created a variety of different animal-based robots to fulfill a 
              variety of different underwater research tasks. For example, the 
              U-CAT underwater robotic turtle was designed for the purpose of 
              exploring underwater shipwrecks and was given four 
              highly-maneuverable flippers to do so. Alternatively, robots like 
              the Crabster CR200, which were designed to navigate the ocean floor,
              take inspiration from different animals like crabs and lobsters, 
              both of which are skilled at navigating the terrain. However, many
              of these robots were not designed with speed or energy consumption
              in mind. In order to create the most energy-efficient robot, we must
              first determine which animals are the most energy-efficient swimmers.
              After discovering this animal, we will identify which features allow
              it to achieve its efficiency. From that point, we will start to 
              design a bot in “Auto Desk” or any other cadding app. This model 
              will be shown to the judges. We will also build a prototype of the
              best robot. It is hypothesized that a jellyfish-themed robot would
              be the most efficient swimmer because jellyfish expend a low amount
              of energy compared to many other aquatic animals. The data from our experiment will be useful because being able to create an energy-efficient robot will allow for underwater research to occur in a fast and resource-friendly manner. </p>
