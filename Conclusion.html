      <h1><u>Conclusion</u></h1>
      <p>In the beginning, we wanted to discover a mechanism that can aid in 
      marine exploration through the detection and tracking of the movement of 
      marine life. We believed that an eyeless shrimp would be the best and 
      effective marine life to model. However, with further research, we discovered
      that a jellyfish will be ideal, for its movement is the most energy efficient.
      In fact, there were already many different concepts of a jellyfish robot 
      that we could pull inspiration from. During our research, we found that 
      scientists estimate that 50% of all marine life remains undiscovered. 
      This means that a machine which can survive in the oceans for an extended 
      period of time without disturbing wildlife would have a good chance at finding
      something new. With our mechanism, we are able to model a more energy 
      efficient robot that can aid and discover new species.  Due to the fact that
      this is a 3d simulation and a 3d model, we are not absolutely sure of the 
      effectiveness of the robot, but it is a good emulation of how the robot 
      would move in water. But the design process isn’t a single line of 
      instructions, it is a circle. We started with a problem, we asked how we could
      solve that problem, we generated a solution to that problem, and now we are
      finding problems with our current solution and asking how we can solve them.
      As of now, we are left with many questions. How can we use fewer sensors to
      track marine life? Are there any other animals more energy efficient than 
      a jellyfish? How can we modify the jellyfish to become more energy efficient?
      In the next cycle of the design process, we look forward to solving these 
      problems, and all the ones that come after, until eventually, we build the
      best robot we can.</p>
