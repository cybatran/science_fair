              <p>When there is a tough decision to make, you're probably used to
              compile a list of pros and cons, phoning a friend, or flipping a 
              coin. These approaches may work when determining what color to 
              paint the new apartment or where to go for dinner, but they probably
              aren't best when it comes to important business decisions. When 
              you're faced with multiple choices and countless variables, a decision
              matrix can clear up confusion about the options and highlight points
              that may factor into the final call. This quantitative method can 
              remove emotion as well as confusion to help you guide your business
              effectively. Unlike a simple list of pros and cons, a decision 
              matrix allows you to place importance on each factor. We used this
              method in order to discover what the best mechanism is without any 
              bias. To create a decision matrix we created a table. Decision 
              matrices can help you select the best option, but also in 
              prioritizing tasks, problem-solving or even crafting arguments to 
              defend a decision you've already made. List your decision alternatives
              as rows, and the relevant factors affecting the decisions – such as cost,
              ease and effectiveness – as the columns. Then, establish a rating 
              scale to assess the value of each alternative/factor combination. 
              Be sure that the rankings are consistent. For example, if you're 
              looking at pain points, be sure each issue is worded so it gets 
              more points the worse it is. Next, multiply your original ratings 
              by the weighted rankings to get a score. All the factors under each
              option should then be added up. The option that scores the highest
              is the winning choice or the first item to work on. </p>
