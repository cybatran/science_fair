                  The purpose of the experiment was to create an energy-efficient
                  robot to aid in underwater research. It was decided that the 
                  robot’s design would be based on that of a real-life aquatic 
                  creature in order to utilize the creature’s swim patterns and 
                  adaptations. It needed to be determined which aquatic creature
                  possessed the most energy-efficient swim pattern. Online 
                  research was conducted and it was concluded that the jellyfish
                  possessed the most energy-efficient swimming pattern due to its
                  ability to release a burst of movement without expending any 
                  energy. With this information, a 3d model was designed to 
                  blueprint a robot that possessed the design and swim mechanism
                  of a jellyfish. The robot’s model was later implemented into a
                  digital software to simulate how it would move through the 
                  water. This finished simulation represents a step of the design
                  process in which the robot’s design is analyzed and tested. 
                  The next steps include finding ways to make the robot more 
                  effective and more energy-efficient.

                  <p>Since the goal of this project was to create the most 
                  energy-efficient robot, it was necesary for us to be able to 
                  measure the amount of energy consumed by the robot as it 
                  navigated through the water. Therefore, it was necesary for us
                  to implement a data chip that would carry out this function.</p>
